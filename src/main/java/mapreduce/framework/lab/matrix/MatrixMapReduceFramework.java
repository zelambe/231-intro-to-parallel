/**
 * A MapReduce framework that uses a matrix to organize the map tasks and reduce
 * tasks. Unlike the {@link SimpleMapReduceFramework}, this class doesn't
 * require the accumulation stage to run sequentially. It gets around the issue
 * by creating a whole matrix of {@code Map}s, where each row is a map task, and
 * each column is a reduce task.
 * 
 * The {@link #mapAndAccumulateAll(Object[])} method slices up the input and
 * maps each slice to one row, accumulating as it goes. It places items into the
 * correct column based on the {@link #getReduceIndex(Object)} method. Then, the
 * {@link #combineAndFinishAll(Map[][])} method combines the mutable result
 * containers from the various map tasks, and finishes them into the result
 * type.
 * 
 * This is the most difficult part of the assignment, but it's also worth the
 * most. Try doing it sequentially before attempting to parallelize it.
